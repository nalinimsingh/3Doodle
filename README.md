## Requirements
Install the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html). One way to do this is to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), then when you have it installed follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/index.html). You'll also need to make sure you have `adb` installed in the same process.

You'll also need to install [OpenCV](http://www.mobileway.net/2015/02/14/install-opencv-for-python-on-mac-os-x/).

## Setup
Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` in this folder.
